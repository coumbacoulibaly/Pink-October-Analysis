Question:
 Histology:
  -Infiltrating Ductal Carcinoma:
	Invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC), also known as 
	infiltrating ductal carcinoma, is cancer that 
	began growing in a milk duct and has invaded 
	the fibrous or fatty tissue of the breast 
	outside of the duct. IDC is the most common 
	form of breast cancer, representing 80 percent 
	of all breast cancer diagnoses.
  -Infiltrating Lobular Carcinoma:
	Invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC), sometimes 
	called infiltrating lobular carcinoma, is the 
	second most common type of breast cancer after 
	invasive ductal carcinoma.Invasive means that 
	the cancer has “invaded” or spread to the surrounding 
	breast tissues. Lobular means that the cancer began 
	in the milk-producing lobules, which empty out into 
	the ducts that carry milk to the nipple.
  -Mucinous Carcinoma:
 	Mucinous carcinoma of the breast — sometimes called 
	colloid carcinoma — is a rare form of invasive ductal 
	carcinoma (cancer that begins in the milk duct and spreads 
	beyond it into nearby healthy tissue). In this type of cancer, 
	the tumor is made up of abnormal cells that “float” in pools of 
	mucin (proteine), a key ingredient in the slimy, slippery substance 
	known as mucus.
 HER2 status:
	HER2-positive breast cancer is a breast cancer that tests positive 
	for a protein called human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). 
	This protein promotes the growth of cancer cells.
 ER status:	
	Estrogen receptor (ER) positive. The cells of this type of breast cancer 
	have receptors that allow them to use the hormone estrogen to grow.
 PR status:
	Progesterone receptor (PR) positive. This type of breast cancer is sensitive 
	to progesterone, and the cells have receptors that allow them to use this hormone 
	to grow.
